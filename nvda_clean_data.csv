360 total security and how to get rid of it?. please please tell me there is a way that my husband and i can get rid of this on our own as totally blind people? we have the latest version of jaws as well as the latest version of nvda and will use whichever one will let us do this and are using windows 10. when my husband got an icloud update this program got on our computer and it now is us from updating to the latest twblue or using it at all. its also slowing the computer down somewhat too. we have and use viper and are amazed it allowed this on here. the program is not with either jaws or nvda and we have tried to remove it the normal way to remove a program with no success. if anyone can help or knows anything about this please email me either privately or on list? . lisa email facebook twitter philmore box shared with hubby god bless everyone

battery programs. i have my nomitor always turned off.if a sighted person wants to use my computer they can turn on the screen.i am not sure what kinds of you had want to do since generally most things you can do to the laptop are from the windows control panel under screen saver or something similar. generally there is battery status in the system tray though if you need a program to show you battery status i have one i wrote years ago because it was not for me to keep going to the system tray just to check my battery status this program just pops up shows me my charge and time left i think it is been a while since i have had a windows laptop then allows me to exit and go back to what i was doing. unless a utility came with your laptop though it is probably not a good idea to try to mess around with any other battery settings since that has a tendency to break things and i do not know any programs that do that anyway though i am sure there are some out there for these smart batteries they have these days. anyway if the windows saver screens do not give you the control you want i do not have any on what else to try.

focus voiceover does it per default the focussed object is with a rectangle its very usefull for visual impaired and to show something to a sighted person. am um 1911 schrieb brian vogel let me tell you as a sighted person who tutors jaws mostly that the focus highlight addon is helpful and one of the most appealing features available under nvda for me. it is very difficult for most folks and those of us with sight to wrap our heads around the virtual cursor and the fact that as a general rule and for good reason from a practical most screen reader software makes no effort to make the screen track with where the virtual cursor is located and match that up. even when you the virtual cursor and that what is in the window you are working on is buffered if it is complex it becomes wellnigh for a sighted person to have any idea of where you really are once you have been working with things that are not visible on the screen. focus highlight makes it much easier for me as a tutor and for any sighted assistant you might call upon to know exactly what it is that currently has focus. and for those who interact with it enough the various line colors andor squiggles contained within those colored lines tell us exactly what screen reader state is currently active for that item with focus. this addon was and remains a stroke of for between screen reader users and the clueless or even clued in sighted folks who would like to help but are lost if they cannot literally see what you are operating on. brian version 1703 build 15063.296 home 64bit the opposite of a correct statement is a false but the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth. niels bohr domingos de oliveira karth userstra e 13 53129 bonn tel 0176 322 45 129 web
folders or separate accounts. jeff this question does not have an easy answer without having the context of how you are accessing your email pop or imap. if it is imap and you set up your filters and folders on your server side which is what it is presumed you you will do then those folders will propagate out for display on each and every device on which you are accessing that account. if you happen to be using gmail when you create the filters and labels gmail lingo for folders you can even tell it to apply those filters to all of your existing messages in your inbox as well as then applying them to any new incoming messages. gmail also allows you to run a filter test so that you know exactly what messages would be captured by that filter before you actually make it active. i would presume that similar exist on imap servers in general. if you happen to be using gmail and want for creating filters and labels respond to me privately and i will send them as a pdf or a msword document. this group does not allow and mores the pity. pop is a whole different ball of wax and if you are using multiple devices to access email keeping things in sync over time becomes wellnigh that was one of the reasons the imap protocol came into brianhere is a test to find out whether your mission in life is complete. if you re alive it isn t. lauren bacall

is any release prior to the latest stable release and thenext rc release view all topics mute. well stability is caused by drivers malware hardware issues and well microsoft causes issues. all those updates true of late they are to stop people clicking things but ms can happily break its own os. to ilistrate it all dos all versions up to 6.22 fine. win 3.1 fine. win95 ok ish 95 osr2 fine. 98 ok ish 98se fine bar usb issues. me bad. 2000 good. xp retail crap sp1 ok sp2 better sp3 well same as sp2. vista. previded you turned off uac and a few other things good enough but basically crap. win7 good. win8 crap win 8.1 better but still crap win 10. the desktop is fine. but thats about it. the start menu is ok i guess but still i prefured win7s. the explorer with all those ribbons is basically universal apps well we can stop there. bar the times i used groove and granted for what i needed it for was fine universal apps while they may have a place on a tablet or smart phone i repeat do not have any use what so ever on a pc. neither do the automatic ms accounts and all that junk. if you are a standard user using standard desktop apps well. there are also on what things can be done right now according to articles. to be honest if there was a way to run either an xpwin7 shell not just the start menu but the explorer shell as well i would do that the old sound recorder was good for short files. in fact i found win7 to be the best os. win10 is good if and when it works but not good if it does not and the bottem line is that while windows has got more stable when it breaks we have no idea what it is and how to fix it. at least if my older dos broke you could find and fix the module replace the drive or just reinstall if needed. in windows xp i must admit the system did break a lot with out mirror drivers meaning you had to reformat a lot. in 7 i havnt had that happen fully just yet. i am close to a system which has just used it for 6 years with broken bits ok.
is there any way to stop windows 10 updates from with my everyone. so i ve heard all the arguments and i m not here to bitch about windows always wanting to update itself. however i must say i am very annoyed. sometimes when windows updates changes i have made are getting revoked and reset back to their original values. examples would be windows mobile device centre which at some point between and creators update disabled a setting that i need to use my old windows me device with the computer a braille note if anyone s curious. cortana itself even though i took action to disable it. more to this list a while ago i became very annoyed at the long pauses microsoft core voice inserts between sentences and after detecting a comma. i was by a very helpful person on this list to edit an .ini file which although it was not quite in the location he specified did the trick very nicely. well here we go again nvda using ms core voices is pausing for as much as two seconds between sentences and i hate it. of course i m going to go back into that .ini file and change it again. how long before microsoft in their infinite wisdom decides that no i really don t want things set the way i say i want and undoes what i took time and effort to change? how can i prevent this sort of garbage from happening or is this just the kind of thing pc users have to live with nowadays? in advance for any help. jm

mouse with nvda do you use it? do you like it?. yes you will not see them if you are not taught to work with the web page and rely on i very strongly believe that teaching the internet well is done by teaching how to work directly with web pages and not with such as links lists. blind people should know that you can tab or use commands provided by to move from link to link. they should also know that you often have to use the arrow keys to see if there is text or other controls between links. it depends on context. but using the mouse is not the answer. learning to browse as a blind person is the answer to effective web page blind people generally have a lot of problems browsing web pages because they do not know how to use existing methods i work with a recording program where the time elapsed in a playing file can be seen using the nvda screen review commands. using a mouse may provide the same access i have not used the feature you are so i do not know. but that is an example the content is not by using standard methods such as the arrow keys to find and read it where other are i am not convinced that the nvda screen review commands do not give as good or better access in terms of to such content in many cases. there are times when moving a physical mouse using the feature you are may provide the ability to do but it would be important to hear specific examples from people and to know whether those people know and use the commands provided by nvda as well. gene

nvda 2017.3 and outlook 2003. all as this thread i wonder if at some point someone will show up wanting support for windows 3.1x? it may seem however old habits die hard in the apple computer world there are those who claim that they can still use their apple iic. so wait for those who will want supports from nvda for their vintage pcs on 10132017 805 am brian vogel wrote on fri oct 13 2017 at 0701 am brians mail list account wrote i do agree that if something can be done to make a working bit of existing software still work when nvda is being used then it should be. and even i will agree with that if you append the proviso so long as doing so does not involve breaking with more recent versions. there are a lot of issues with jaws lately too but they are on the flip side of the coin in that they are not keeping up quickly enough with how current windows has been evolving. anyone who needs to maintain between a screen reader and older software that they wish to use can and should do the same thing for the screen reader that they are doing for the software do not update. it is easy to maintain an archive of the for the various versions of nvda for instance and to revert back to any on of them if a later version ends up breaking with something old and has done so because it must to currently produced software. you just have to remember to turn off and that should be something that any end user of any software that is aware they need to do and not just for screen reader software if they are trying to use ancient software that is no longer if they do not something is bound to break. its not like what i have proposed is or even but the lies with the users who either want to or need to freeze time on their machines. they cannot expect active support for full backward in its never happened and it is never going to happen. there are limited resources to devote and those will always be devoted to keeping current when it comes to a viable product in the when we are talking if a choice has to be made regarding backward or with what is happening now the choice is 100 certain to be the latter. brian windows 10 home 64bit version 1703 build 15063 dot level on request it changes too often to keep in signature the opposite of a correct statement is a false but the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth. niels bohr carlos gonzalez los angeles ca.

nvda not working on web sites. suddenly this morning nvda cannot read web sites. when i press tab i keep hearing unknown and i cannot move around on the page. else seems to work normally such as email notepad tw blue and my other usual programs. i had a sighted person confirm that the web pages look normal and can be navigated normally with the mouse. it appears as if some keyboard change has taken place with nvdas but i cannot figure this one out. i am using the current version of nvda and windows 10. this occurs both in firefox and ie. any ideas? rich de steno

problem. carret browsing mode has nothing to do with a it is a browser feature and is of no use to blind users. if nvda key 7 causes your browser to ask about carrote browse mode it is because your browser is not working with nvda properly and it cannot execute the nvda command to bring up the links list. sometimes the only thing to do when problems arise is to use another browser. if the problem only occurs on one site then you can use a different browser on only one site. we will probably never know why this obscure problem occurs on your machine using one web site one browser and nvda. at this point the question is what happens when you use another browser? gene

new nvda sounds. well it seems many did not. i think a lot of it was the higher pitched sounds were not heard by those with hearing loss. since the code is not in nvda for allowing these to be changed it was felt i think that they would leave it till people could use this function. however if you want to manually change them it is easy. if you kept the old snap or its archive you can run it let it extract as a portable version to a folder then go there grab the waves folder and copy it to the one in the installed copy. do this while not running it though. then restart the installed copy and they will be in there till you do an update at which point you need to copy them again. what i have done is renamed the waves to waves2 and then just copied waves to that folder. this should make it easier next time to change them. if you do not have a snap them let us know on here i am sure somebody has a copy brian sent via please address personal email to putting brian gaff in the display name field.

running a windows xp virtual machine. the vast majority of machines offer no access to bios settings once an operating system is running therefore no there is no way to use nvda to adjust bios settings. the only method i have ever come across for adjusting bios settings is with a hardware speech output device such as dectalk or lite talk which can function without any software support on the machine and therefore does not care that there is no operating system running at the time. antony.

the more or less finished tutorial. here is the revised version with to the nvda key made people who want to keep andor the tutorial should keep this version. if no other changes are suggested that i adopt i will send a message to the list in a day or two saying that this copy the copy i said to keep is the final version. gene moving from to nvda a very short tutorial telling you just what you need to know to do a lot of what you did before. first a word about using the tutorial. i explain concepts in the tutorial but much of what i do is to give commands that are different in nvda. as i explain a lot of what you do will not change but certain things will require different commands. to use this tutorial many commands i give might be very useful. for example when i give screen review commands stopping reading and in this document might help you remember and learn them. when i describe input help turning it on and trying different keys and of keys might be helpful. you will find for example that the screen review commands i give are announced when you have key describer on and issue the commands. that will help you review quickly and if you for get any of them something that is far more likely to occur in the laptop layout than the desktop layout. now that i have suggested ways to use it the tutorial begins. many people are about switching to nvda or any other from this tutorial will explain and that such are largely based on before i discuss the that causes most of this i will briefly discuss nvda and changing the used and speech nvda has a talking run the file as you would any file. you may get a dialog asking if you want to run the file. use the command alt r for run. if you get a uac prompt answer alt y. run narrator. then run the nvda when you run the installer there will be a pause and then a bit of music will play. not long after the talking installer will run. unload narrator at that point. return to the install dialog. tab through the dchoices. accept the license agreement and then tab to install. you will get other options but install is the one you want. dont stop using nvda because of the voice. a lot of people do not try nvda because of the voice. as soon as you get it set up i will tell you how to change the used. when nvda is installed and running a dialog box comes up with some text and the ability to set one or two options. while i know a lot of people very much dislike the default voice it is worth listening to the dialog and looking at the settings by tabbing through them. i would recommend checking the check box to use caps lock as an nvda modifier. youll see why i recommend this in later after you go through the initial dialog it is time to learn how to change the first a word on by default nvda uses either insert in with other keys to give commands to the i shall refer to the nvda key when i am refering to these keys. also you can tell nvda to use the caps lock key as an nvda key as well. at times this is very when i say nvda key it refers to any of these keys. to change the issue the command control nvda key s. a selection dialog will open. you will see a list of different possibly available choose sapi 5. i know everyone has at least one sapi 5 voice on their machine. up and down arrow through the list and stop on sapi five. press enter. you will now hear another voice. it may be the same voice you hear in narrator. now issue the command control nvda key v. you are now in the voice selection and dialog. up and down arrow to see what voices are stop on the one you want. now tab through the dialog and change settings for the voice. once you find a voice you want and tab through and set whatever you want such as speed and press the ok button. now let us continue with what i spoke of at the start of this tutorial. the that makes the switch to nvda from or from any other seem daunting is that the user does not realize that most of the commands heshe uses are windows commands and program commands and they will not change. consider the following examples opening menus was and still is alt. thats a windows command to open menus in programs. its the same no matter which you use. control o for open does not change. using the arrow keys to move in a document does not change. tabbing through dialogs does not change. neither does how you move in a list or a treeview or work with a combo box and the list goes on. commands many of which may change such as read title bar provide access to you cannot get or cannot get by using windows or program commands. for example read title bar. in the command is control shift t. in nvda it is nvda key t. the title bar is something a sighted person looks at. you cannot move to it with the pc cursor or cursor whatever you wish to call it because there is no need. a sighted person can just see it. so the has a command read title bar. that command is not a windows nor a program command. here are the commands you will need to know to allow you to do a lot of what you did before. to unload nvda nvda key q then enter. read title bar nvda key t. time nvda key f12. announce nvda key f. read current window nvda b. in the command is control shift w. read to end nvda key down arrow. use the down arrow on the main keyboard. in the laptop layout read to end is nvda key a. stop speech with control as with in general. i am about to discuss commands. those let you review the screen without changing the position of the cursor when editing a document or changing where you are in a dialog or anywhere else. but first i will point out that commands such as left arrow right arrow control home control end control left arrow and control right arrow are windows movement commands for moving in any standard edit field including word processor edit fields. none of them will change. screen review commands note the pattern as i give these commands read previous line numpad 7. read current line numpad 8. read next line numpad nine. you move in screen review to the previous or next line when you issue those commands. you can keep moving and reading until you get to the top or bottom of the screen. read previous word numpad 4. read current word numpad 5. read next word numpad 6. read previous character numpad 1. read current character numpad 2. read next character numpad 3. note the pattern. read current is the key in the middle of each of these rows. move to and read previous is the key on the left. move to and read next is the key to the right. the lower the numbers the smaller the movement unit. 1 2 and 3 move by 4 5 and 6 move by word etc. now here are the laptop layout review commands read current line nvda key shift period move to and read next line nvda key down arrow. move to and read previous line nvda key up arrow. read current word nvda key control period read previous word nvda key control left arrow read next word nvda key control right arrow announce current character nvda key period. move to and read previous character nvda key left arrow move to and read next character nvda right arrow. after a little more i will tell you how to change the keyboard layout to laptop. getting back to the review keys in the laptop layout there are sort of patterns in the laptop layout but not the kind of uniform pattern as in the desktop layout. if i had a laptop computer without a numpad i would buy a usb numpad and not fool around with the laptop layout. but you can decide that for yourself. but aside from keys such as that period is used for current and that left and right arrows are useed with modifiers you cannot more. such patterns are not followed in every previous and next item. in one of the previous and next items up and down arrow is used. i shall now explain how to change the layout from the desktop to the laptop layout and discuss causing the caps lock to be used as an nvda key. if you add capslock you can still use either insert. there are times when caps lock is very to open the keyboard layout issue the command control nvda key k. you are now in a list of layouts. the desktop is the default and the first in the list. if you want to switch to the laptop layout down arrow once and then tab to and activate the ok button. you will notice as you tab check boxes about which keys serve as the nvda key. caps lock is not checked. check it with the space bar. you can stay in the desk top layout and still tab and see these check boxes. i use the caps lock key as an nvda key often and i use the desktop layout. i find it much more to use for the read to end command. i hold caps lock and press down arrow. that is to me much more than using insert down arrow of which insert i use. if you want to toggle caps lock on and off for typing press it twice quickly. if you press it once and hold it it serves as an nvda key. if you press it twice quickly it toggles caps lock on and off. here are two more important commands jump to top of window shift numpad 7. laptop layout command control nvda key home. jump to bottom of window is shift numpad 9. laptop layout command control nvda key end. i have said top and bottom of window but that is it depends what kind of review mode you are using. i will not go into that to any extent in this very short tutorial. if you are reviewing material in a word processor use the review commands i have given. if you are in a dialog or some other in order to see what is on screen change to screen review mode. to do this use the command nvda key numpad 7. here it is most to use the numpad insert as the nvda key in the desktop layout. in the laptop layout the command is nvda key page up. issue the command and repeat it if necessary until you hear screen review. then you can use the review commands such as numpad 7 8 9 etc. to review what is on screen. use the same commands i gave earlier for review. to left click with the mouse route the mouse to the review position with the command nvda key numpad slash. in the desktop layout again it is most to use the numpad insert. then left click with numpad slash by itself. that is the same command you left click wwith in if you want to right click route the mouse with the same command nvda key numpad slash then use numpad star the key to the right of numpad slash the key to the right of the left click key. in other words you right click with the same key you use in after you have finished working in screen review it is very important to return to object review. issue the command nvda key numpad one in the desktop layout. again the numpad insert is most to use. the laptop layout command is nvda key page down. repeat the command if necessary until you hear object review. if you do not do this you will often hear incorrect about where you are when you do various things in nvda. screen review though the commands are different is similar in concept to using the mouse pointer in object is different from any review mode in i will not teach its use here but you will find a of it in a tutorial i will give an address for later in this tutorial. depending on how you use your computer you may find it very useful. that is just about all i will teach in this very short tutorial. as i said its purpose is to allow you to do much of what you do with quickly and easily. but i will tell you a few more things. internet browsing when you are on a web page quick commands are almost identical whether you are using nvda or move by headings is h. skip blocks of links is n. move to next button is b next combo box is c. next check box is x. nvda has an input help mode which is similar to what is in nvda key and 1 on the main keyboard turns it on. when you press a key or of keys that might be a command you will hear what the keys are and what if any command they execute. this varies depending on where you are. when in a browser that supports browse mode typing a lot of letters will give you about what the keys do in browse mode. i already gave much of that above but you may want to press a lot of keys using input mode in a browser. to turn input mode off use the same command you used to turn it on nvda key 1. to learn more about nvda a popular tutorial is available at on that page you will see links to download different sections of the tutorial dealing with different subjects. you can also download the entire tutorial as a zip file. there is also an email list for nvda users. to join send a blank message to this address i hope that this tutorial has removed much of your about switching to nvda. now as you wish or need you may consult the tutorial i gave a link to. nvda is a powerful and it will meet a lot of users needs as well as jaws or does. i hope this very short tutorial gives you a good on which to build that the should be much easier than you may have thought and that it will help make it much more

virtual recorder. you keep saying the choice is between your sound card and your voice. when you record your voice you are recording using the input of your sound card. the real of this program are that it allows you to record from both a virtual device and a sound card so you can mix things in more ways. you can also record from just a virtual device. the virtual device ability allows you to record things such as internet streams even if your sound card does not support the what you hear or stereo mix option. this option has other names as well. if your sound card supports it you can record anything your sound card plays. it has become difficult to find sound cards that support stereomix in later versions of windows. virtual device gives you another way to do the same thing and may save you a good deal of fooling around and may save you the need to purchahse another sound card. in other words when you record from your soundcard you can record whatever sources your sound card supports. if you set your sound card to line in you can record linein. if you set your sound card recording source to you can record using your etc. when using the virtual device setting you can record as though your sound card supports stereo mix. but you are not recording using your sound card. if this is difficult to i will attempt to explain it further but more people might be in the program and might realize more ways in which it can be used if they this but one example is that if you want to record an internet stream and your sound card does not support stereo mix you can use the virtual device setting to record the stream as it plays. but if you do you cannot do things such as use a the will be recorded as well. gene

webaim screen reader user survey 7 getting the word out about nvda. it is not the fault of the they were not being unfair. however it is done in a nonprofit model such as nvda or in a for profit model the costs could be made small or nvda is free because it was decided by the to fund it in other ways and that is one way to do it. in the case of a for profit the price to anyone who buys it and is certified as qualified that is as being blind or not to be able to read a screen could have the subsidize the cost. a tax such as a penny or less per something sold such as for every computer sold could raise money for this purpose and for other purposes. but it is not the tiny companies making who are to blame. it is that nothing has been done to make available for little or no money while providing the companies a profit. the reason nvda exists is that no such were made to make for profit gene original message i totally agree with you erick. the education that deliver equipment to students in vancouver and around bc and here in victoria haven t really embraced nvda but i can see them embracing nvda sooner rather than later. remember fs always saw its main as a threat. since the main is now gone vfo could raise the price of jaws a lot higher say to 10000 or so and that would force to go with nvda.

why is an addon on firefox such a nasrin gene is correct. security measures are often with a period of where they can be disabled to give who are not proactive and the users of their products time to get things ready for firm all addons will require digital signature in the not too distant future. any unsigned addons that are currently in the latest version of firefox are doing so because tweaks have been made by the user to the deep browser settings to override the digital signature you will not be able to make that override in it makes no sense to leave gaping security loopholes because it is easier for and endusers who do not want to keep up with threats that have been to make security certain simply stop working on things for other reasons too and it is quite clear that webvisum is dead in the long term. the digital signing done on the version is just that a but no ones keeping anything up on the back end which is necessary for ongoing

a problem reading a pdf file. its a problem with the file normally. its probably been made with a different package. the problem is that the character nvda sees is not actually so this is why its not actually seen as such. not a lot one can do unless somebody at nv access can figure out what the character is which is coming out to the and mask it out somehow. brian sent via please address personal email to putting brian gaff in the display name field.
a for a future release of nvda. tis puzzled me also. maybe he means automatic say all. and this very much depends on how outlook as an off linne reader is set up. one has to be careful as outlook is now the new name for hotmail formerly live formally msn etc etc and he may mean the web based system which seems to have been designed by a colour blind non keyboard using person. brian sent via please address personal email to putting brian gaff in the display name field.

an idea for possible new nvda all this may or may not have been discussed hear already so hear goes. i have a vizio ct14 it has one of those keyboards which does not contain a number pad and it s not possible as far as i know to emulate one by pressing fn key i use the laptop keyboard layout with nvda and i like it. however i also use a wireless keyboard when i m away from the laptop. would it be possible to have a separate keyboard layout for this keyboard? this doesn t seem to be possible yet but is anyone in either adding this to nvda or as an optional add on? i m not sure if this is even possible and if it were you d have to detect the type of keyboard eg usb ps2 etc. this would allow you to have separate layouts for each keyboard you use. the reason i m asking is because the settings ring doesn t seem to exist in the laptop keyboard layout. if it does i haven t been able to discover the keyboard shortcuts bound to it. the voice settings dialog seems to have a bug. opening it and changing a setting eg rate and then pressing the ok button does not close the dialog. pressing the escape key does close it but also reverts the setting changed. this is with nvda 2017.4. this occurs with windows onecore as well as the built in espeak synth. this isn t a complaint just an idea. is anyone or have any feedback? kendell clark sent from mail for windows 10

changing how nvda reads numbers.
changing the reading order in thunder bird. you do not have to delete columns and i would not assume the order of adding them would affect the order in which they are i have not looked at the on the site but there are two even after all these years things you can do by dragging and dropping. you can change which columns are shown and you can also change their order. but whether you can move headers up or down in any other way such as you suggest is something i do not know and instead of with this perhaps possible solution the best approach would be i think to learn how to move headers. people wrote methods to do this using jaws and with the demise of this may not be available any longer. but someone adapted the procedure for jaws. you might be able to find the procedure by doing google searches for something like changing order headers jaws and another search for the same phrase with used instead of jaws. or maybe someone will tell you how using nvda or another here. as i recall you need to find graphics and not just try to move things when you are on text. gene gene i can never get this method of changing order of columns to work. i am also seeing that you can remove columns one by one. i have not had the nerve to try this yet but i wonder if you were to remove all the columns and then add them one by one would they come in the order you added them?

enhancing microsoft word. . i tested both and open office and read many online materials and about them. it depend on your need that which one you select. but i mentione for you points that i know andare prominent for me. 1 is more and less need for java. but open office is more relies on java. for example only needs java for macros data base etc. but open office needs java for macros data base saving to xml and some vizard like letter fax agenda and web page. saves inboth microsoft office 2003 and new office formats like doc ppt docx pptx etc. but open office only saves in microsoft office 2003 formats. 2 supports word count and character count in all of the format which support in its version before version 5. but in version 5.0 and later it only supports word and character count only for its special format which is .odt. open office does not have this option. and format is special feature of 3 both programs support many formats for openning and range of formats is more wide. for example even supports many formats of mac for openning. 4 in version 4.3 shows its messages very by tab key and you can easily press tab and with using home to go to first character and pressing control shift end you can select it copy it and peist in other place. but the messages are not easily in other programs and you should nvda screen review and other nvda cursors to access it. 5 has somecloud online services and open office does not have. for example google drive one drive etc. 6 since version 4.4 has an option for opengl and open office does not have. its very strungly to it in tools options view. 7 say all does not work in both and open office and you should read your documents paragraph by 8 somesaid that open office is more stable and has more features that open office has not. 9 open office to limited languages and you can select and install only your own language. but is to more than 110 languages and when you install it it your locale language in your windows. it installs only english and your local language. 10 help file should be installed but open office help is installed by default. 11 if you want more you have refer to this link for example and also email me. for your question and god bless you.

getting the repeting of the subject line in an email to stop repeting when you open a message. the following is a bit technical so i ll try my best to explain what s going on. but first to answer casey s original question nvda from message fields when you open a message outlook etc. yes and no. let me address the no answer first as i think it is important to some behind the scenes worknvda is armed with to deal with specific controls and how it should act for example nvda can treat some lists as tables announce terminal output read dialog texts and so on. to house these termed behaviors in nvda world a specific subsystem is devoted to telling nvda how it should act when meeting certain controls. this subsystem is divided into two parts behaviors mixin a of to work with various controls such as dialogs. control each api layer allows to specify what nvda should do when meeting specific advantage of this is that it is easy to extend this subsystem but with a cost once known nvda will hold onto known controls. but it is possible to tweak behaviors and add on top of it for example telling nvda to announce dialog text in reverse order.now the yes answer it might be possible to tell nvda to not announce message headers provided that nvda can recognize such cases. this is because message headers are housed inside a dialog and this one is a generic dialog from nvda s or in some cases nvda is told to announce contents of a window technical at least in outlook window class name for this dialog is 32770 very generic msaa dialog and it s the matter of and attaching it to an overlay class. this is similar to what i did back in june to deal with newer style user account control dialog in windows 10 version 1607 took me two days to figure out the class name for the dialog and told nvda to treat what appeared to be a window as a dialog because it was a secure screen i had to write a custom global plugin to figure out what was happening inside. a challenge for wouldbe aspiring nvda i might not be able to do it for a while due to speech write a working algorithm that solves casey s issue. define the problem your research findings source code file that needs to be modified why your idea is good and that it actually works. for bonus points add one or more notes cases where your work would and will fail i put this as a bonus point so you can think carefully before writing your solution. i ll accept solutions from those who are and dedicated to help someone in our community despite setbacks. willing to learn nvda source code. i will add bonus points if you address your solution as though you are talking to casey directly. are willing to explain in simple terms what s going on don t copy me come up with in your own words. if writing source code conform to nv access coding style camel case tabs for etc.. i added these for an important reason should be servants and see solutions from users someone who have never heard of python nvda source code and what not. please send your solutions to me directly and i ll accept answers until end of october. whichever receives highest points from judges will be for inclusion in an nvda issue i d like to ask some seasoned devs here to be judges.

keyboard question. actually i thought the nvda insert key was the numberpad insert key even if the keyboard had another insert key as well. i am using a keyboard here which has the usual main keyboard layout with all the letters and numbers etc and the return key towards the righthand side and also has a numberpad layout over to the right of the keyboard but in between those two is a set of six keys three across two down plus four more three across on one row with an extra key in the middle on the next row up. the six keys in a group have insert at the top left which is what i think you mean by a hard insert key but that one does not work as an nvda key only the large zero key on the number pad over to the right does that. antony.
locked this is the moderator speaking question regarding eloquence for nvda from code factory. and that is what i liked about it. the ability to gut your own software all the fun is kind a gone out of it with the registry and if it stuffs then you cannot ripp out a module and change it its all or nothing. it does not happen often that things really go but when they do its the os is to complex to find what a module does anymore. if it screws its faster to restore an image or just reformat and hope it does not go nuts again. in the early days things did not misbehave much but it was easy enough to just clear the issue without the os. had a friend get scared and turn off his computer because he had never heard the drive scan at all before. managed to wreck his mbr and os image. i upgraded his os and put his old configs back. he lost nothing and gained a new os upgrade. another time a shareware program at a school i was at expired and went off and took out the os at startup. i was able to remoove the offending lines and then uninstall the app weell till i got permition to buy and install a full one. in windows is central which is fun till it fails which granted it does not often so you have more time to do mails like this and not however if it fails it can be solved maybe or it may be easier to restart and hope after a full reformat and program update of you think is the issue that it well works. and if you are lucky it will for a time.
locked why does seem that so many blind people are so against change?. there against change because they cannot see it you like to get out of that stagnant pool if you could?
looking for a free and for usenet searching reading and grabbing binary files. lol you are welcome. i did not even think to look at on my way to do so now. maybe one of us can answer the nvda question after we venture into guinea pig mode for a bit. travis to sent thursday march 16 2017 358 pm subject re nvda looking for a free and for usenet searching reading and grabbing binary files heh enough wikipedia has a page for nntp readers. i do not know which ones if any are but that might be a good starting point. i have never used nntp on windows only on linuxunix and i have used programs like trn and nn and in a pinch pine. there is a windows version of pine now called alpine which works fairly well and it can handle nntp servers so that may be an option if you cannot find anything else. i have not delved into the usenet groups for many many years but i sure do miss them perhaps this will give me the insentive to get involved with them again. for the on 3162017 557 pm kwork wrote i am looking for a free and with nvda that will access usenet including reading searching and will also be able to grab binary files. if there are any nvda usenet users here i would any help. i am using windows 7 64bit and nvda 2017.1. travis

making a program was spss how much learning and work do you want to do? others will probably comment on this but there are people in the community who will work on making programs when but how many there are and how available their services are i do not know. i am sure you can learn how to do things like script but you might rather look into having someone do this. gene from travis siegel sent wednesday november 16 2016 1246 pm to subject re nvda making a program was spss its a disk program written in c but that is the process for making a program with nvda should be somewhere and i want to find that so i can make this program whether it be via scripting or some other process. once that is done i will more than likely use the same process assuming there is such a process to make other not programs usable. perhaps this is the wrong list to be asking these questions but i have to start on 11162016 112 pm brian vogel wrote what sort of base program are we talking about here? a great many programs again depending on age and how widely used alternate text to allow graphics of any type to be labeled and most screen readers rely on that alternate text to tell you what the graphic you have landed on happens to be. its well nigh to tell anything based on most icon file names. i am also trying to envision the sort of program being discussed which is almost certainly not web based or you had have scripting support related to browser already in place but does present on the screen. since icons are mentioned i would have to believe a gui is involved too. brian here is a test to find out whether your mission in life is complete. if you re alive it isn t. lauren bacall this email has been checked for viruses by avast antivirus software.

nvda errors with word
nvda freezing in web browsers. well this new laptop so far is working good. but i only had it a day and i refreshed windows so i have a nice clean install. the latest amd seem to be lots better than the vintage 2006 or 2007 ones. the ones for windows vista... this computer is very fast. for a 250 machine with 4gigs of ddr3l l means low power ram it is working very very good. sent with mozilla email clientit can i think only be done in 7 and 10. in these systems you can elect to throttle back the processor to save battery on laptops and to keep processor down. i have never found such a thing in xp but it is possible that some laptops have something like this if they are multi core processor driven. brian sent via please address personal email to putting brian gaff in the display name field.

nvda sounds. hey for the feedback the reaction from everyone was very mixed. so yes we have reverted back to the old sounds for now. the intention is to look at a way of making it easy for users to setup share use sound schemes so that you could change to the scheme you like best or make your own. we were not quite ready for that just yet as 2017.3 is just around the corner. we hope to revisit sounds again though and let everyone choose what they want. regards quentin.

question about between current versions of nvda since 2017.1 about
question about turning pages in adobe reader dc using nvda as my screen reader. i just saved a pdf from a website and want to read it but the keyboard commands for turning pages do not work for me. i am working with windows 7 and reading the pdf with adobe reader dc. nvda is my only screen reader choice. the text on the page reads but for some strange reason i cannot turn pages or scroll to do reading using only the keyboard. if someone uses the mouse on my pc nvda can read onward through pages but having somebody mouse through this lengthy document for me is not a solution. is there something i am missing in terms of using the keyboard and nvda to read through this pdf document? the arrow keys do not work as the view menu says they should. lm

repairing inte3rnet explorer. didnt you say the same problem occurs in other browsers when you tested this morning? when you trouble shoot if the problem occurs in more than one program and it is the same problem then the problem is not caused by the programs but let us be very clear about what the problem is. can you use commands such as b to move by button x to move by check box and h to move by header? read to end nvda key down arrow would not be expected to work when using the insert. does it work when you use caps lock down arrow? also when you use commands like read title bar when on the desktop or in programs like notepad is the title bar read? i am not sure what the symptoms are of the dll problem and i do not know if they match your problem. with detailed those who are more familiar with the symptoms may be able to determine if the symptoms match. depending on whether the list can solve the problem or not more may be needed later. this may not be needed now but such questions as just what work was done on the computer? you said windows was from where? from an disk or from the recovery partition on the computer or somewhere else? was any other work done? as i said these questions may not need to be answered now but answering them may be useful or important in future. gene

using physical mouse with nvda?. and that last message should have said mouse tracking rather than mouse though if you land on a button or link you want to follow you can if you so choose just click. this generally works much better with either a mouse pad or a touch screen than a real mouse on a monitor but even that can work once you get the hang of it. not everyone or even the majority will want to bother but it is worth giving a try. now jaws is also doing the of mouse tracking in jaws 18. brian windows 10 home 64bit version 1703 build 15063 dot level on request it changes too often to keep in signature the opposite of a correct statement is a false but the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth. niels bohras gene noted there is little reason for a totally blind user to use the mouse both because without being able to see where you are moving it is very hard to get it exactly where you need and often it is easier to use the keyboard to jump to elements. if there is a specific page you are having trouble accessing that you can post the url for here i can have a look and try and give some pointers. we do have a few low vision users who might have enough sight to use the mouse to get to a page and point on a page but then rely on nvda to read the text. nvda can read the text under the mouse pointer. press nvdam to toggle mouse tracking on or off when on it will read the text under the mouse pointer as you move the mouse. the review cursor and object can often be used to get to parts of the screen that regular may not work with and there are nvda commands to click the left or right mouse buttons but usually these are used as when other fails in a instance. regards quentin.
